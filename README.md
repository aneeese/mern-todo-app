# MERN Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built in the MERN stack. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently. Authentication and authorization are implemented using `JWT tokens`, ensuring secure access to the app. Additionally, the `Zustand` package is used for state management.

## Features

- Users can `register` themselves to create an account and access the app.
- After successful registration, users can `log in` to the app.
- Upon logging in, users are directed to the `dashboard` page.
- Users can add a new task by clicking a `button` or pressing the `enter key`.
- User tasks are displayed in the form of a list on the dashboard.
- Each task in the list has two actions:
  - `Checkbox`: Users can mark a task as complete by checking the checkbox.
  - `Delete Button`: Users can remove a task from the database by clicking the delete button.
- Appropriate styling is applied when the user checks the checkbox, providing visual feedback.
